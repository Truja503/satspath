# SatsPath — Development Status Summary

*Snapshot of repo `satspath` at commit `92b8f9a` (30 Jun 2026). Plain-language summary of the main features built, their key characteristics, and their status.*

**Status legend:** ✅ stable / done · 🆕 new · 🧪 experimental (flag-gated) · 🚧 WIP (not merged) · ⚠️ needs a decision

| Feature | Key characteristics | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Identity & signed profiles** | Human alias → secp256k1 public-key identity; list of payment methods; ECDSA signature over canonical JSON; 8-char fingerprint; optional expiry | ✅ Stable |
| **Payment methods** | Lightning (Lightning Address / LNURL / BOLT12), On-chain (multiple addresses, network-aware), Ark (server + pubkey pointer) | ✅ Stable model — Lightning does a real LNURL→invoice fetch; Ark is preview-only |
| **Routing engine** | Rule-based: Lightning if amount < 100k sats → On-chain if next-block fee ≤ 20 sat/vB → Ark → else no route; live mempool fees with safe fallback | ✅ Stable (a 2nd score-based engine exists but is not wired in) |
| **Registry & resolver chain** | Local file registry, then BIP-353, then HTTP well-known, then Nostr; trust is on the signature, not the server | ✅ Stable |
| **BIP-353 DNS payment instructions** | Resolve `₿user@domain` to a DNSSEC-signed `bitcoin:` URI; can also publish instructions; DNSSEC mandatory, fails closed | 🆕 New — resolver/preview only (never pays, signs, or broadcasts) |
| **Universal URI & QR** | `satspath:<alias>` and `satspath:v1:<payload>`; BIP-21 `bitcoin:`, `lightning:`, and Ark pointers; payloads screened for private data | ✅ Stable |
| **Ownership proofs (verification)** | Per-method proof with three trust tiers — cryptographic (key signature), domain-control (well-known / Lightning-Address), self-asserted; bound to identity + method, re-checked at resolve time | ✅ Done — richer than a minimal MVP needs |
| **Unregistered-user invite / claim** | Non-custodial by design: the sender never creates the receiver's keys; invite carries alias-hash, amount, expiry, warning | ✅ Done (invite side); claim is the receiver's own flow |
| **UX quote JSON contract** | `quote(recipient, amount_sats)` → one JSON the UI renders by `status` (ok / not_registered / no_route / invalid_signature); `PaymentMethod` embedded unchanged; CLI `quote --json` | ✅ Done (PR #25) — ⚠️ a second, richer shape now also exists (see note 1) |
| **Mainnet preview mode (v2)** | Resolves, routes, and builds a payment payload under mainnet rules; adds an execution `mode`, ownership tier, and `warnings` | 🆕 New — preview only, no funds move and nothing is broadcast |
| **P2P profile transfer** | `export` a signed profile as JSON; `import` from file / stdin / HTTPS URL with signature + expiry checks (rejects tampered profiles) | 🆕 New (offline transfer works); networked P2P (`holepunch` SDK) is 🚧 WIP, not merged |
| **Swap engine (Boltz) + ark-bridge** | Submarine / reverse / chain swaps; Node.js Ark bridge sidecar | 🧪 Experimental — testnet only, behind explicit flags |
| **CLI** | `init, register, show, encode, decode, quote, pay, invite, demo, dns, peer, preview` | ✅ Done — primary interface today (human text + ASCII QR; JSON on `quote`/`preview`) |
| **Safety posture** | Preview-only everywhere: no real send, no spend-signing, no broadcast; private-material screening; output masking by default | ✅ Enforced across the codebase |

## Notes

1. **Two quote response shapes now exist** — worth a decision before building the UI:
   - `quote --json` (router, PR #25): embeds the raw `PaymentMethod`; four-state enum; the shape our contract docs describe.
   - `preview` command (mainnet preview v2): a richer JSON with a **reshaped** method plus `mode`, per-recipient/per-method **ownership** tier, and a **warnings** list; all fields optional.
   These overlap but are not identical. The UX should target one of them (the `preview` shape is the newer, richer one).

2. **Scope.** The must-have MVP core — identity, signed profiles, signing/verification, routing, invite flow, and the quote JSON — is **complete and stable**. Several areas (ownership proofs, BIP-353 DNS, mainnet preview, P2P transfer, swaps) go **beyond a minimal MVP**: ambitious, but the UX-facing core is stable.

3. **Nothing executes real payments.** By design this is a signed-profile *resolver + router + preview*. Real send/broadcast, PSBT signing, and Ark VTXO client-side validation are strictly delegated to the host Wallet. SatsPath acts solely as the routing protocol.
